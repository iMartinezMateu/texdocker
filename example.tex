  \TeX Docker is a container that runs on Docker and contains a full \TeX{}Â Live distribution, so it can be used to compile a document on the host system. It supports \LaTeX{} which was originally written

  % The following shows typesetting power of LaTeX:
  \begin{align}
    E_0 &= mc^2                              \\
    E &= \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \end{align}
